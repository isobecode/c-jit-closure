C doesn't have closures, so making an apply function isn't usually possible... unless you do what I did here. Using x86_64 machine code, I JIT compiled a "trampoline" function which stores the applied argument as a constant and on call, invokes the real function with RDI being the applied argument and all other arguments being shifted one over
